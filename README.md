# number-guessing-game
This is a simple number guessing game where computer generates a random number and you try to guess it. It even has feedbacks like "too low" or "too high". The game loops endlessly until you finally guess the correct number. This has helped me incorporate variables, if statements and loops in python into a fun game.
